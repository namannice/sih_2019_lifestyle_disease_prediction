## Smart India Hackathon
Innovation and entrepreneurship are at the peak in India. In order to make development a comprehensive mass movement and innovate on all fronts, MHRD, AICTE, i4c and Persistent Systems have come together to organise Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2019 - a unique Open Innovation Model for identifying new and disruptive technology innovations to solve the challenges faced in our country. It's a non-stop product development competition, where problem statements are posed to technology students for innovative solutions. It can help to:
Harness creativity & expertise of students
Spark institute-level hackathons
Build funnel for 'Startup India' campaign
Crowdsource solutions for improving governance and quality of life
Provide opportunity to citizens to provide innovative solutions to India's daunting problems
The first two editions SIH2017 and SIH2018 proved to be extremely successful in promoting innovation, out-of-the-box thinking in young minds, especially engineering students from across India.
Smart India Hackathon (SIH), Software Edition is all set to be conducted on March 2 and March 3, 2019.
